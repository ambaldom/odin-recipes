    <h4>Description</h4>

    <p> In Hawaii, spam musubis are eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We eat them on the plane, at school or work, during sporting events, at the beach, and at home. You might not like spam but when you eat a spam musubi you will love spam. The spam musubi comes from the old plantation days and has evolved to become Hawaii's favorite snack! </p>
