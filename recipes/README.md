Odin Recipes 

The project is a series of web pages showing my favorite recipes. 

The first phase of the project solely uses HTML. 

The project showcases soft and hard skills such as problem solving, creativity, organization, the use of tags including titles, paragraphs, headings, organized and unorganized lists, absolute and relative links, and images.
